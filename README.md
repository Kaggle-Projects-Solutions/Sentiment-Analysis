This project was created for fun and out of curiosity. The aim was not only to used sentiment analysis but also clean and prepare data and determine if Homer's speaking lines are positive, negative or neutral by using VADER. I have also used NCR Emotion Lexicon to establish proportion of speech related to certain emotion.

### Targets
 1. Clean and prepare data for sentiment analysis.
 2. Use VADER to determine Homer's sentiment positivity/negativity. 
 3. Use Nrc Emotion Lexicon to determine protortion of speech related to certain emotion.
 4. Create Wordclouds and treemap for 50 most frequent words used by Homer.
